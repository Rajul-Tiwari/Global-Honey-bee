Resolving 404 URLs and Search Console Issue
*******************************************

Identifying and Removing 404 URLs:


Priority Matrix: Apply a prioritization matrix to determine the criticality of each 404 URL. Factors such as 
traffic, inbound links, and content relevance serve as criteria for prioritization.

Redirect Strategy: Develop a redirection strategy, treating 301 redirects as essential milestones. These redirects
 act as bridges to guide users smoothly between pages.

Custom 404 Page Design: Design a user-friendly custom 404 error page. Consider it as a critical user interface 
element to maintain a positive user experience.

Content Restoration or Removal Plan: Create a structured plan to decide whether to restore or remove content. 
This is similar to a decision-making process in project management.

Notifying Search Engines:

Integration with Google Tools: Utilize Google Search Console as an integrated part of your project management 
tools. This is your command center for search engine communication.

Documentation and Reporting: Prepare a project report detailing all the changes, and specifically request the 
removal of 404 URLs through the "Removals" tool in Google Search Console.

Sitemap Management: The project includes the systematic management of your XML sitemap to ensure it aligns with 
the changes made.

Re-Crawling Requests: As a part of the project, send re-crawling requests for crucial pages, especially those 
with 301 redirects, to Google using the 'Fetch as Google' tool.

Monitoring and Reporting Progress: Monitor the progress of your project in Google Search Console, tracking how 
many 404 URLs are being removed from the index.




Preventing Future Issues:

Scheduled Audits: Implement periodic audits as a part of the project plan to proactively catch and address 404 
issues.

Change Management Protocol: Define a change management protocol to ensure that 301 redirects are systematically 
applied whenever URLs change.

Link Monitoring Framework: Create a framework for monitoring links, both internally and externally, to prevent 
future broken links.

Scheduled Sitemap Updates: Include scheduled sitemap updates as a recurring task within your project management 
plan.

User-Centric Error Handling: Incorporate user-friendly error handling, which is a project deliverable, to enhance 
user experience.

Team Training Plan: As part of your project, establish a training plan to educate team members about URL 
management best practices.

Version Control System: Consider the implementation of a version control system to manage changes as part of your 
project's technical infrastructure.

Archiving and Backup Protocol: Develop a protocol for archiving and backing up content, ensuring no valuable data 
is lost.

Continuous Improvement Feedback Loop: Implement a continuous improvement feedback loop as part of your project 
to capture and address user feedback and reported issues.

Content Management Roadmap: Develop a content management roadmap, treating it as an essential aspect of ongoing 
project management.
